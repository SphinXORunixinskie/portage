# In the 17.0 profiles we assume that our system compiler uses C++14
# or later as default language setting. This means it has to be at
# least GCC 6. If you need an older compiler for specific purposes,
# feel free to unmask it, however, using it for normal emerging of
# packages is neither recommended nor supported in any way.

# We can unmask ICU 59 and later now we for sure have a recent GCC
# Note: "and later" is safe here since the profiles/package.mask
# still overrides.
