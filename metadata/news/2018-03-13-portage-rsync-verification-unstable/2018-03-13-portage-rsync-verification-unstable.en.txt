Portage rsync tree verification is being temporarily turned off by
default, starting with sys-apps/portage-2.3.24. This permits
stabilization of sys-apps/portage-2.3.24 while still working on bugs
relating to tree verification [1]: deadlocks [2] & key fetching [3].

If users wish to enable the 'rsync-verify' USE flag for sys-apps/portage,
they need to follow these steps:

1) In order to unmask the 'rsync-verify' USE flag, create a file named
/etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask containing a line like the
following:

    sys-apps/portage -rsync-verify

2) Once the 'rsync-verify' USE flag has been unmasked as described
in step 1, it can be enabled with a line like the following in
/etc/portage/package.use:

    sys-apps/portage rsync-verify

3) After the configuration changes in steps 1 and 2 have been made, run
the following command:

    emerge --oneshot --newuse '>=sys-apps/portage-2.3.24'

After all above steps are successfully completed, a line like the
following should appear in the emerge --info output for the gentoo
repository:

    sync-rsync-verify-metamanifest: yes

If you wish to disable it for some reason, you can set
'sync-rsync-verify-metamanifest = no' in your repos.conf.
