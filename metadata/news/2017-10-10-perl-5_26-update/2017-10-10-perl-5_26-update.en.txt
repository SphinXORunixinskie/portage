Title: Perl 5.26 update: possible breakage
Author: Andreas K. Hüttel <dilfridge@gentoo.org>

Revision: 1
News-Item-Format: 2.0
Display-If-Installed: >=dev-lang/perl-5.26.0

You have just upgraded to Perl 5.26. This release brings several 
incompatible changes, as a result of deprecations coming to term
and of changes in default settings to mitigate a potential
security issue [1].

While we have made sure that all resulting build failures within 
Gentoo are fixed, this may not be the case for runtime issues, 
and certainly can affect third-party code (e.g., "hand-installed" 
server applications).

Typical errors are:
* Can't locate inc/... in @INC (you may need to install the inc::... module)
* error: ... has no member named ‘op_sibling’
* Unescaped left brace in regex is illegal in ...

Please see the pages [2,3] for details and report bugs if you run
into problems during or after the Perl update.

General purpose advice on updating Perl can be found on page [4].
